#jsplot

`jsplot` is a graphical package that introduces smooth, light-weight event-based animation to statistical graphics. Unlike traditional animations in R, users are able to select a geom (i.e. points, lines, features) on graphs and schedule animations on these elements, based on events like clicking, hovering, and panning. `jsplot` implemeted layered plots, and is also an R interface to the animations provided in D3.js, implemented using HTMLwidget.
